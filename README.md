# Clustering
Clustering is a technique in machine learning that groups similar data points together based on their characteristics. It is an unsupervised learning method that relies on finding similarities between data points without any prior knowledge of the data set. 

Clustering can be used for market segmentation, social network analysis, search result grouping, medical imaging, image segmentation, and anomaly detection among other applications.

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is used to group unlabeled datasets into a cluster. It is also known as hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA. 

In this algorithm, we develop the hierarchy of clusters in the form of a tree, and this tree-shaped structure is known as the dendrogram. 

The hierarchical clustering technique has two approaches: 
Agglomerative and Divisive
